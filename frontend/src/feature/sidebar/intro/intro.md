New York City's government includes a system of 59 community board districts that offer a way for the public to get involved with local politics. Many New Yorkers don't know they exist, and the process to get involved can seem overwhelming.

Most boards don't provide an easy way to get notified of upcoming meetings, making participation difficult.
59Boards [scrapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) event information from board websites and provides a feed for your calendar app's subscription feature.
